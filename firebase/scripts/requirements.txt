# Firebase Setup Scripts - Python Dependencies

# No external Python packages required for basic setup
# All scripts use only Python standard library

# However, if you want to install the Firebase Admin SDK for advanced operations:
# firebase-admin>=6.0.0

# For enhanced CLI interactions:
# click>=8.0.0
# colorama>=0.4.6  # For Windows color support

# For configuration validation:
# jsonschema>=4.0.0

# Note: The current scripts are designed to work with Python 3.8+ standard library
# and delegate to Firebase CLI and FlutterFire CLI for all Firebase operations.
